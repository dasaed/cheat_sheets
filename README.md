# cheat_sheets

This is just a list of cheat sheets I've gather from multiple sources. I just wanted to keep all of them in a single place. This is very useful content, so I do recommend looking up the original author's and checking out their books. 

Most of the python cheat sheets I got them from:

For HTML and front-end related content, I really recommend this website:
